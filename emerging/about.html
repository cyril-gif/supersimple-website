<p><em>DISCUSS DATA TYPES FROM PROGRAMMING AND ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVES
</em>OVERVIEW OF DATA TPYPES FROM PROGRAMMING PERSPECTIVE</p>

A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer 
intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, 
real, character or string, and Boolean

Our interactions (inputs and outputs) with a program are treated in many languages as a stream of bytes. 
These bytes represent data that can be interpreted as representing values that we understand. 
Additionally,
 within a program, we process this data in various ways such as adding them up or sorting them. 
This data comes in different forms. Examples include:
<p>•	your name – a string of characters
<p>•	your age – usually an integer
<p>•	the amount of money in your pocket – usually a value measured in dollars and cents (something with
 a fractional part)
A major part of understanding how to design and code programs is centered in understanding the types 
of data that we want to manipulate and how to manipulate that data.
Common data types include:
         <div class="input-box">

<p>Key Terms
Boolean: A data type representing logical true or false.
data type: Defines a set of values and a set of operations that can be applied on those values.
Floating point: A data type representing numbers with fractional parts.
Integer: A data type representing whole numbers.
String:   A data type representing a sequence of characters</p>

<p>OVERVIEW OF DATA TYPES FROM ANALYTIC PERSPECTIVE
Most companies are collecting data all the time—but, in its raw form, this data doesn’t really mean anything.
 It’s what you do with the data that counts. Data analytics is the process of analyzing raw data in order to draw
 out patterns, trends, and insights that can tell you something meaningful about a particular area of the business.
 These insights are then used to make smart, data-driven decisions.
</p>
TYPES OF ANALYTIC DATA
Categorical Data: This data represents characteristics or qualitative attributes. 
Examples include gender, color, and country of origin.
<p>2. Numerical Data : This data represents quantitative measurements or values.
Examples include age, height, and income. Numerical data can be further categorized into discrete (e.g., number of children) and continuous (e.g., weight) variables.</p>
<p>3. Missing Data: This data represents values that are not available or not recorded.
Analyzing missing data involves understanding patterns of missingness, imputation techniques, and assessing the impact of missing data on analysis results.</p>
<p>4. Multimodal Data: Multimodal data represent combinations of different data types.
Examples include multimedia data (e.g., images, videos with accompanying text), sensor data (e.g., IoT data with spatial and temporal attributes), and omics data (e.g., genomics data with numerical and categorical attributes)</p>
</p>
<p><em>Introduction to  data  types</em></p>
 1. Metadata means "data about data". Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier 
Examples:
File size,
Data quality,
Source of the data.
<p><em>Types of metadata</em></p>
#. Structural metadata: Provides information on the hierarchical structures between different data resources. This may include a table of contents, page, section, and chapter numbering.</p>
#. Descriptive metadata: It  also define the resource’s physical characteristics, such as its medium type and dimensions
<p>2.Structured data</p>
Structured data is when data is in a standardized format, has a well-defined structure, complies to a data model, follows a persistent order, and is easily accessed by humans and programs. 
Examples:
Javascript object notation(JSON),
Extensible markup language(XML).
<em>Characteristics of structured data</em>
<p>#.The data conforms to a data model and has an easily identifiable structure.</p>
<p>#. The data is stored in rows and columns.</p>
<p>#.The data is well organized, which means that the definition, format, and the meaning of the data is known.<p>
<p>3 Unstructured data</p>
Unstructured data (or unstructured information) is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents.
 <p>Examples of unstructured data include</p> legal documents, audio, chats, video, images, text on a web page, and much more. 
Unstructured data has these features:
<p>#. It has no identifiable structure or data model.</p>
<p>#. It has no obvious organization.</p>
<p>#. It cannot be easily analyzed for meaning or trends by either machines or humans without special training or tools.</p>
3.Semi-structured data
 is a form of structured data that does not obey the tabular structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as self-describing structure.
Examples of semi-structured data include emails, XML and other markup languages, TCP/IP packets, binary executables, zipped files, data integrated from different sources, and web pages
<P>Which information flow step in the data value chain do you think is labour intensive? and why?</p>
The information flow step in the data value chain that is likely to be labor-intensive is data collection. This is because data collection involves the process of gathering raw data from various sources, which often requires significant manual effort.
For instance, data collection may involve the manual entry of data into spreadsheets, databases or other data collection tools. This can be a time-consuming and tedious process that requires significant labor and attention to detail to ensure accuracy
Moreover, in many cases, data collection may involve the use of specialized tools and equipment that require skilled personnel to operate. This could include things like sensors, cameras, or other measurement devices, which need to be calibrated and monitored to ensure that they are collecting accurate data.
<p>What are the different data types and their value chain?</p>
“The value chain describes the full range of activities which are required to bring a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production (involving a combination of physical transformation and the input of various producer services), delivery to final consumers, and final disposal after use.
