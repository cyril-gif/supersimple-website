<p>Stages of artificial intelligence<p>
Artificial intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer sciences that focuses on creating machines that can think and act like humangs. AI systems can perform tasks like understanding natural language, recogninzing objects in images and even playing games. Artificial intelligence means "a man-made thinking power”.
<p>Stage one:
 Rule-base systems: This stages of Ai focused on creating Ai systems base on rules and symbols.it involved programming computers to manipulate symbols and perform logical operations. Example is the IF THEN  Statement.

 <p>Stage 2: 
Context, awareness and retention: this stage of Ai are trained on the knowledge and experience of the best humans, and their Knowledge base can be updated as new situations and queries arise. Well, known Applications of this level are chatbots and “roboadvisors”.
<p>Stage 3:
 Domain-Specific Expertise: Going beyond the capability of humans, these systems build up expertise in a specific Context taking in massive volumes of information which they can use for decision Making. Example of this AI is Google Health.
<p>Stage 4:
 Reasoning Machines: These algorithms have some ability to attribute mental states to themselves and others .They have a sense of beliefs, intentions, knowledge, and how their own logic works. This means they could reason or negotiate with humans and other machines. At the Moment these algorithms are still in development, however, commercial applications are expected within the next few years.
<p>Stage 5:
 Self Aware Systems / Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): These systems have human-like intelligence – the most commonly portrayed AI in media – however, no such use is in evidence today. It is the goal of many working in AI and some believe it could be realized already from 2024
<p>Stage 6: 
Artificial Super intelligence (ASI): AI algorithms can outsmart even the most intelligent humans in every domain. Logically it is difficult for humans to articulate what the capabilities might be, yet we Would hope examples would include solving problems we have failed to so far, such as World hunger and dangerous environmental change. 
<p>Stage 7: 
Singularity and Transcendence: This is the idea that development provided by ASI (Stage 6) leads to a massive Expansion in human capability. Human augmentation could connect our brains to each Other and to a future successor of the current internet, creating a “hive mind” that shares Ideas, solves problems collectively, and even gives others access to our dreams.
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF AI?</p>
Types of Ai base on capabilities 
 <p>Narrow AI: is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with Intelligence. The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the World of Artificial Intelligence.it can’t perform a tasks beyond it limit.it is designed to perform a specific task 
<p>General AI: is a type of artificial intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with Efficiency like a human. 
<p>Super AI: is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass Human intelligence, and can perform any task better than a human with cognitive Properties. This refers to aspects like general wisdom, problem solving and Creativity. It is an outcome of general AI
<p>Types of AI base on Functionality</p>
<p>Reactive machine: Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence .Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions. These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best 
<p>Limited Memory: Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short Period of time. These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only. Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These Cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed Limits, and other information to navigate the road. 
<p>Theory of Mind: Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able To interact socially like humans. This type of AI machines is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of Efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines. 
<p>Self-Awareness: Self-Awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and  selfawareness. These machines will be smarter than the human mind. Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.
<p>A platform, why we need platforms</p>
<p>Platform
A platform is a group of technologies that enables users to build, deploy and manage application service or products ,it is the basic hardware and software on which applications can be run.

<p>Reasons why we need a platform 
Platforms connect various uses, enabling interaction, transactions, and value creation.  Platforms provide a fertile ground for innovation, collaboration and expansion.
<p> AI platforms and their purpose</p>
<p>Tensor flow:
Developed by google, Tensor flow is an open -source machine learning frame work that allow developers to build and deploy machine learning model for a wide range of task such as image recognition and more.
  
<p> IBM Watson :
Is a cognitive computing platform that provides a range of Ai service, including natural language processing, image recognition and chartbox development.it is used by businesses to build Ai powered applications and service.
<p>Tool</p>
In the context of an Ai, A tool refers to software applications, libraries, framework and platforms that facilitate the development, deployment, and management of Ai systems.

<p> Examples of Ai tools include</p>
 <p> Predictive Analytics:
This tool use Ai algorithms to analyze historical data and make predictions about the future outcome. tools like Rapid miner and Data robot are popular for predictive Analytics. 
<p> Natural language toolkit (NLTK):
This Ai tool help computers to understand, interpret and generate human language
